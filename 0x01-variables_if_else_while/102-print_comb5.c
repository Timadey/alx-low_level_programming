/*
 * main - The starting point of the program
 * Description: Write a program that prints
 * all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
 *
 * The numbers should range from 0 to 99
 * The two numbers should be separated by a space
 * All numbers should be printed with two digits.
 *  1 should be printed as 01
 * The combination of numbers must be separated by comma,
 * followed by a space
 * The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
 * 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as
 * the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
 * You can only use the putchar function
 *  (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
 * You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code
 * You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
 * All your code should be in the main function
 *
 * Return: 0, void or non-zero value when an error occurs
